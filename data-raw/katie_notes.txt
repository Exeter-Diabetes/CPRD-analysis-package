To add new download:
* Update 'setup_databases.sql' to add new databases and permissions
* Update lookup-tables.yaml with new filenames for medical and product dictionaries and drug substance class lookup and oha lookup (last 2 files need adding manually)
* Add HES lookups to reference-files folder
* (Run bash script to unzip and rezip folders - each zip needs files for one table only (and >1 file I think) - have bash script to sort this out in C:\Users\ky279\OneDrive - University of Exeter\CPRD\2025\Linkage and MM data\denominator_id_files)
* Make/update .aurum.full-load.yaml with database names and location of raw data on server / where staging should take place (make sure staging area is emptied if previous attempts)
* Clone CPRD-analysis-package into home folder on Slade using: 'git clone https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-analysis-package'
* Using Command prompt/MobaXTerm, move to folder where package is
* Run 'module load R'
* Run (dev): 'nohup Rscript CPRD-analysis-package/data-raw/cprd-data-setup.R "dev" &> nohup-dementia.out &'
or (prod): 'nohup Rscript CPRD-analysis-package/data-raw/cprd-data-setup.R "prod" &> nohup-dementia.out &'
* NB: script points to default .aurum.full-load.yaml or can add as argument: 'nohup Rscript CPRD-analysis-package/data-raw/cprd-data-setup.R "prod" ".aurum.full-load2.yaml" &> nohup-diabetes.out &'
* NB: changing staging table name: need to change in operational-tables.yaml AND cprd-data-setup script (stageParams)

Previously had issue with zip files from CPRD system not being able to be unzipped by R
I have bash file in CPRD/2024/MySQL loading to unzip and rezip

Tables made:
* All primary care tables, also all HES APC (except maternity), patient and practice IMD, and ONS death, plus lookups for these
* Linkage tables and their lookups will be empty if data not provided but no errors
* All these tables, plus patient_test, practice_test, observation_test and drug_issue_test and r_valid_date_lookup need to be present to connect via R
* SQL scripts in data-raw to make above 5 tables
* patids_with_linkage is made but empty

Data QC after loading:
* Have been repairing all tables to check indexes are all fine
* Check row counts vs log files from CPRD system
* Check all patients are acceptable==1, patienttypeid==3 and no missing/0 regstartdates


Further work:
* Decide whether any codelists need updating - medications might
* Check numunitid changes for biomarkers if want to use EHRBiomarkr package? Between 2020 and 2024 seemed fine (no changes)


* Check whether death data has decimal points in ICD10 codes or not (HES does) - in 2020 did, in 2024 didn't
